  * Large pressure cooker or crockpot
  * Large frying pan
  * Spatula
  * Spatula-sized ladle or spoon

## Ingredients
If you don't like an ingredient by itself, just leave it out of the dish. Add or remove as you see fit.
  * 3 large cans of crushed, diced, or whole-peeled tomatoes
  * 2 cans black beans
  * 2 cans dark red kidney beans
  * 2 cans chickpeas
  * 3-4 pounds ground beef
  * 7oz can of chipotle peppers in adobo sause
  * Any kind of tortilla chips
  * (optional) jalape√±os, other beans, whatever you want

## Spices 
Notice: Season your food until the sprits of your ancestors whisper _"that's enough, my child"_.
  * _At least_ 3oz chili powder
  * Roughly 1oz or more of Mexican spice or taco seasoning mix
  * A healthy amount of salt, a dash of pepper
  * A small to moderate amount of cumin 
  * (optional) A small to moderate amount of cayenne pepper
  * (optional) Whatever spices you want

## Directions 
1. Wash all of the beans in a colander.
2. Add all of the spices and non-meats (except for the chips) into a pressure cooker or crockpot, stir, then cook for a few hours.
3. Cook the meat separately in a pan on low or medium-low heat. Stir it regularly for even cooking. Drain the fat regularly as it accumulates. Don't bother seasoning.
4. Set the pressure cooker or crockpot to warm. Add the cooked meat to it if there's space. Otherwise combine things in your bowl as you take servings.
5. Eat with a spoon or tortilla chips.
